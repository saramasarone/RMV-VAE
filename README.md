# Representation Learning to Effectively Integrate and Interpret Omics Data
Scripts are currently organised by experiment:

* BRCA_ER, BRCA_Survival, 
* BRCA_ER_NORM, 
* BRCA_Surv_NORM, 
* PAAD, PAAD_NORM

To run this script on your data you'll need:

- two omics datasets 
- optional - clinical data to predict outcomes 


To perform attribute regularisation you can use one of the existing scripts (with *NORM* in the folder name) and substitute our datasets with yours.
